# Cinema of Babel

The Cinema of Babel is a program that translates an image chosen by the user into a unique block of text which can then be converted back into the original image.

The user may also choose to start with a custom block of text and convert it to a unique image.

Any change made to the block of text produced by the original image will produce a completely new image.
